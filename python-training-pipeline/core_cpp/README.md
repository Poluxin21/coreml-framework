# README for C++ Core Framework

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the C++ core framework used in conjunction with the Python training pipeline. The core framework is designed to facilitate the integration of C++ components with Python-based machine learning workflows.

## Building the Core Framework
To build the C++ core framework, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++) and CMake.

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the C++ core framework.

3. **Navigate to the Core Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/python-training-pipeline/core_cpp
   ```

4. **Create a Build Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

5. **Run CMake**:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

6. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage
Once the core framework is built, you can integrate it with the Python training pipeline. The C++ components can be called from Python using bindings such as Pybind11 or Boost.Python.

### Example Integration
To use the C++ core components in your Python scripts, ensure that the compiled libraries are accessible in your Python environment. You can then import and utilize the C++ functions as needed.

## Contributing
Contributions to the C++ core framework are welcome. Please follow the standard contribution guidelines and ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
